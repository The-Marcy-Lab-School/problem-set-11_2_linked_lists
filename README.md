# Problem Set 11.2 - Linked Lists

## Directions
Answer short response questions directly within this document. Format your responses with proper Markdown. Complete code challenges in `linkedlist.py` or `linkedList.js`.

### Short Response
**1. What are the tradeoffs between linked lists and arrays?**

**2. What are the tradeoffs between singly linked lists and doubly linked lists?**

**3. What are the run times for insertion, deletion, and accessing from linked lists?**

**4. What is an abstract data type?**

### Coding Challenges
1. Implement a `LinkedList` class that responds to all of the listed class methods.

2. Given a singly linked list, write a function which takes in the first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating if the linked list contains a "cycle". A cycle is when a node's next point actually points back to a previous node in the list. This is also sometimes known as a circularly linked list.

3. Write a function to reverse a linked list in place. The function will take in the head of the list as input and return the new head of the list.

4. Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should
be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

  For example:
  ```
  Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
  Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
  ```

5. Write a function that removes duplicates from a linked list and returns the list.
